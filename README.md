  <h2 align="center">Software Engineer from Chile</h2>
<p align="left">I am a Software Engineer with more than a decade of experience. I can say with certainty that it is important to be up to date with the most innovative technologies, however a good design will make a difference. I specialize in Front End, being able to lead teams, implement architectures and contribute to UI/UX. Also, I am doing research in native app development with iOS.</p>
